> "We find things... see?"

This library helps with pathfinding and other graph algorithms.
It is very closely based upon [simple-graphs](https://github.com/earlygrey/simple-graphs), but
changes some features to make serializing graphs easier, and integrates more closely into
[libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), which this has as a dependency.
